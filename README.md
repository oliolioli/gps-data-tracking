# GPS-data-tracking
Deal with GPS trajectories, measure and convert them.

## What does it do?
Reads an entire file of gps coordinates from different trajectories:

### Calculating difference in altitude between departure and arrival
- Calculates and displays the difference between the altitude of departure and that of arrival.
- Calculates the total rise.

### Calculates GPS coordinates into Cartesian coordinates
- Using Cartesian coordinates, calculates the total distance of the trajectory.
- Calculates the slope (Î” altitude / distance) of each segment of the trajectory, and displays the maximum slope.
