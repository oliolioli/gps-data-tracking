# gps-data-tracking
Deal with GPS trajectories, measure and convert them.

Reads an entire file of gps coordinates from different trajectories:

i) Calculates and displays the difference between the altitude of departure and that of arrival.

ii) Calculates the total rise.

iii) Transforms each GPS coordinate into Cartesian coordinates.

iv) Using Cartesian coordinates, calculates the total distance of the trajectory.

v) Calculates the slope (Î” altitude / distance) of each segment of the trajectory, and displays the maximum slope.
